# Google Stock Market Predictor
Utilizes Yahoo finance as an API & retrieves data for use. Implements machine learning with the use of a Recurrent Neural Network in order to provide a prediction of Google stocks. Incorporates visulaization in the form of a table and graph in order to display predicted stock values with actual stock values.


*NOTE: This was an attempt to get as close to the actual values as I possibly could, there is no solid way to predict the stock market with 100% accuracy.*
