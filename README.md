# Google Stock Market Predictor
Utilizes Yahoo finance as an API & retrieves data for use. Implements machine learning with the use of a Recurrent Neural Network in order to provide a prediction of Google stocks. Incorporates visulaization in the form of a table and graph in order to display predicted stock values with actual stock values.

STEP 1)
The first step is importing the necessary libraries in which we will be using for this project.

STEP 2)
Implement the use of pandas' Datareader by grabbing the necessary information we need. In this case, I am grabbing Google's stocks from Yahoo Finance for the dates of Jan 1, 2015 to April 10, 2020. You can also choose to view the data you are working with by calling back the function afterwards.

STEP 3)
View the size of your data as a whole

STEP 4) (Optional)
Visuzlaization of prior closing prices for Google within the stock market.









*NOTE: This was an attempt to get as close to the actual values as I possibly could, there is no solid way to predict the stock market with 100% accuracy.*
